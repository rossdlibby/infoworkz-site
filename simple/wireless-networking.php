		'<p>In buildings where fixed cabling is not an option, for example a listed building, there exists an option to create a networking infrastructure based purely upon wireless technology or a mixture of both wired and wireless.</p>',
		'<p>Action Communication can design and install the complete wireless networking cabling infrastructure for both 11Mbps (IEEE802.11b) and 54Mbps (IEEE802.11g) wireless networks.</p>',
		'<h3>Outdoor Optical Wireless Bridge</h3>',
		'<p>Optical wireless bridges are fast becoming the communications solution between two locations where a clear line of sight, up to a distance in excess of 1.24 (2km) miles exists. In such cases, they offer extensive cost savings over leased lines. They also offer the ideal solution where fixed cabling may not be possible. They offer better security than other wireless link options like Radio or Microwave and require no special license for installation and use.</p>',
		'<p>Their ease of set up makes them cost effective not just for permanent links but also for temporary installations.</p>',
		'<h3>Laser Based Free Space Optical Wireless Links</h3>',
		'<p>Laser Based Free Space Optical Wireless Links are robust and maintenance free (requiring only an occasional clean of the glass window on the head) and offer speeds in excess of 1Gbps. They are also capable of duplex voice and data links and high quality analogue video transmission.</p>',
