		'<h3>Integration Development</h3>',
		'<p>If you wanted to customize an existing off-the-shelf application to fit your needs ten years ago, you would have two options: Incur huge customization costs or rewrite the application from scratch. Today, most core back-office application packages use standard open-ended technologies that provide other means to unlock the data trapped within their systems. Chances are that 80 - 90% of your business works just like your competitors\' and that the core back-office application that you own works just like theirs. The last 10% - 20% is what makes your business unique from your competitors - and defines your competitive edge. Integration development can customize or extend your core application to make it work the way you do, providing a 100% solution. Improving the efficiency of that last 10 - 20% allows you to capitalize on your competitive edge. <br>Infoworkz Solutions Group specializes in integration development and has an in-depth understanding of how to be successful when integrating with other systems.</p>',
